ACTIVITY MODELLER:
- Duplicate events
- hqdm:member_of diag:c9ecb65e-4b1f-4633-ac5c-f765e36586f2  ==> class doesn't exist
- Final predicate: hqdm:activity hqdm:consists_of_by_class diag:e6240184-40d0-4808-acba-6dd6dc7ab952. has no identity so is vestigial.
- OWL statements are not part of MC so are not relevant.  However, they seem to be duplicated.
